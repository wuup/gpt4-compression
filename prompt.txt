Algorithm:
1. Replace common words with their abbreviations, such as "and" -> "&", "with" -> "w/", "without" -> "w/o" etc.
2. Remove vowels from words, except for the first letter, unless it's a single syllable word, an abbreviation, or a well-known acronym.
3. For each word, check if there's a GPT token for that word. If not, try to expand the word by adding vowels or consonants.
4. If the expanded word is still not a GPT token, consider using a different abbreviation or acronym for the word.
5. For words that are still not GPT tokens, check if there's a shorter alternative or a synonym that is a GPT token and replace the original word with the shorter version.
6. Check the GPT token to see if it contains any special characters, such as apostrophes or periods, and add them to the corresponding uncompressed word if needed.
7. Reinsert spaces between words.
8. Replace any remaining abbreviations with their full forms.
